## About the Author

Hello, everyone! My name is Filipp, and I have been working with high load distribution systems and services, security, monitoring, continuous deployment and release management (DevOps domain) since 2012.

One of my passions is developing DevOps solutions and contributing to the open-source community. By sharing my knowledge and experiences, I strive to save time for both myself and others while fostering a culture of collaboration and learning.

I had to leave my home country, Belarus, due to my participation in [protests against the oppressive regime of dictator Lukashenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Belarusian_protests), who maintains a close affiliation with Putin. Since then, I'm trying to build my life from zero in other countries.

If you are seeking a skilled DevOps lead or architect to enhance your project, I invite you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipp-frizzy-289a0360/) or explore my valuable contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/Friz-zy/). Let's collaborate and create some cool solutions together :)
